Sequences from tomato were retrieved from NCBI Genbank. Sequences from Calibrachoa pygmaea were retrieved from a draft transcriptome of floral tissue and identified through BLAST homology with Petunia query sequences. Petunia sequences were identified from published genomes (P. axillaris, P. inflata from Bombareley et al. 2016) and draft genomes (P. exserta, P. secreta) and confirmed in transcriptomes of floral tissue.
Nucleotide and amino acid alignments were first aligned with MAFFT in Geneious, then aligned by codon with PAL2NAL (http://www.bork.embl.de/pal2nal/#RunP2N).
