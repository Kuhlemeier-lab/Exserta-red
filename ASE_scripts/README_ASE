ASE - allele-specific expression scripts. These were developed by M. Moser for Esfeld

Please start with your coordinate-sorted bamfiles. You need two parental species and F1 hybrids.
Here we mapped P. exserta parental species bamfiles to the P. axillaris reference genome to create variant files.
Then we took the biallelic SNPs, filtered out variants that were shared with P. axillaris or for which P. axillaris was variable itself.
Then, we call variants in the F1s. We count and sort using Python.
Last, we use MBASED in R.

Use the scripts in the order:
1
2
3
4
5 python
6 R script MBASED
